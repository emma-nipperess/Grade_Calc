# Grade Calc


## Inspiration

I have this code written in excel but to format it the precise way I wanted, I had to start writing the code in VBA which is such a drag.

I also have drawn inspiration from a streamer who shall not be named. You may figure it out. 

## How to use

Because I don't want to pay for a server or database or be responsible for potentially leaking my own data (#humble cause I know only I will use this), the site uses the browser's local storage. So you may return to this page with the data saved provided you return via the same device and browser profile.
